The above graph compares the occurences of different types of diabetes with average BMI and standard deviation. 0=no diabetes, 1= diabetes 1, and 2=diabetes 2

This graph correlates the types of diabetes with the occurences of High blood pressure. a score of 1 is 100% and a score of .7 is 70% occurence.

This graph correlates the type of diabetes with the occurences of High cholesterol. A score of 1 is 100% and a score of .7 is 70% occurence.

The type of diabetes has many strong indicators in lifestyle and physiology that can be collectively used to predict whether or not someone likely has diabetes.
